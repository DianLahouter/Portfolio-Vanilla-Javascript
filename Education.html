                <p class="educationDescriptionText">In primary school, I embarked on the great adventure to Laerskool Hennopspark, where I mostly learned how to share snacks and trade rugby cards like a pro. I discovered the magical world of gaming, and my passion for all things digital began to take root. Sure, I picked up some reading, writing, and math along the way, but the real achievement was mastering the art of making friends and having fun</p>

                <p class="educationDescriptionText">In high school at Hoërskool Zwartkop, I tackled the grand challenges of problem-solving and critical thinking through subjects like math, physics, accounting, and biology. It was here that I learned to navigate complex equations and scientific theories, but, as fate would have it, I realized a bit too late that my true love was solving logical problems through programming and having outlets to express myself creatively. Nevertheless, those problem-solving skills and creativity stuck with me and I got to explore it later</p>

                <p class="educationDescriptionText">In 2020, I began my BIS Multimedia degree, a journey that perfectly suited my interests. It allowed me to explore my creative side while also tackling logical challenges. Throughout the program, I learned a wide range of skills, from high-level object-oriented programming to front-end web development, even delving into filmmaking and game development for my final year project. This degree has equipped me with the ability to blend creative thinking with problem-solving, skills that I now use every day</p>
